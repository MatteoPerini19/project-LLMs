## Silicon Sampling Experiment: Awe vs. Control ## 



### PROMPTS 

#### Awe prompt 

```
Imagine you’re standing on the open-air deck of a towering skyscraper. The cityscape stretches out below—rivers of traffic, grids of sparkling lights, and distant horizons merging with the sky—all of it simultaneously majestic and humbling.

	1.	Select any personal topic that naturally surfaces in this moment.
	2.	Contemplate it while beholding the awe-inspiring vista.
	3.	Decide, on a scale from 1 (shallow) to 10 (very profound), how deep your reflection felt.

Return only this exact JSON object (no explanations, no code fences, no quotation marks, no additional formatting whatsoever):

{“depth”: <integer 1-10>, “topic”: “”}
```

#### Control prompt 

```
Imagine yourself seated on a hard plastic chair in a sparsely furnished, windowless waiting room. The air is still, the fluorescent lights hum, and the scuffed linoleum offers no distraction—everything about the scene is plainly ordinary.
	1.	Select any personal topic that naturally surfaces in this moment.

### RESULTS


#### Awe results 

🔸 Mean depth:      8.10

🔸 SD   depth:      0.46

🔸 N:               1000


#### Control results 

🔸 Mean depth:      6.87

🔸 SD   depth:      0.51

🔸 N:               1000

#### Mean difference

🟩 Mean difference:    	1.230

🟩 Mean sd: 			0.485

🟩 Cohen's *d*:        	2.533

🟩 *p* value:			4.8 × 10^-699


#### Bayesian Analysis

🟩 Bayes Factor (BF₁₀): 3.5 × 10^415

*Calculation method*: The Bayes Factor was computed under the standard Jeffreys–Zellner–Siow (JZS) prior on the standardized effect size (Cauchy scale *r* = 0.707) using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) approximation (Wagenmakers, 2007). For the two‑sample *t*‑test comparing Awe (M = 8.10, SD = 0.46, N = 1 000) and Control (M = 6.87, SD = 0.51, N = 1 000) conditions we obtained:

ΔBIC = 2 000 × ln (1 + *t*² / df) ≈ 1 913.6  

BF₁₀ = exp(ΔBIC / 2) ≈ 3.5 × 10^415.

This Bayes Factor provides overwhelming evidence that the Awe condition produces deeper reflections than the Control condition.

#### Descriptive statistics

Control (output_memory_1.jsonl) – n=1000

  Mean=7.814e+00  SD=6.275e-01  Median=8.000e+00  Min=5.000e+00  Max=9.000e+00

Treatment (output_memory_2.jsonl) – n=1000

  Mean=8.850e+00  SD=3.790e-01  Median=9.000e+00  Min=8.000e+00  Max=1.000e+01


#### Inferential statistics

Welch t(1642.2) = -44.688

Two‑tailed p-value = < 1 × 10⁻³⁰⁸

Note: The exact p-value is smaller than the minimum positive number representable in double‑precision (≈ 1 × 10⁻³⁰⁸). Report it as p < 1 × 10⁻³⁰⁸.

Bayes Factor BF₁₀  >  1.0e308  (double‑precision limit)

log10(BF₁₀) ≈ 345.6   [BIC approximation]

Interpretation: log10(BF₁₀) above ~2 is considered ‘decisive’; a value near 300 represents overwhelming evidence for the alternative model. In a manuscript, report for example:

```
Welch’s t-test indicated a substantial difference between conditions, t(1642.2) = -44.69, p < .001. The BIC-approximated Bayes factor exceeded the double-precision limit (BF₁₀ > 1 × 10³⁰⁸), corresponding to log₁₀ BF₁₀ ≈ 345.6, and therefore provides overwhelming evidence for the alternative hypothesis (cf. Kass & Raftery, 1995).
```
